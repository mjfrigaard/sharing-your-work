# Motivation

We read [this interesting article on fivethirtyeight](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/democratic-debate-poll/) about the democratic debates in June of 2019. In particular, the image below that displays how voters had changed their minds after watching the candidates. 

```{r 03-538-night-one-debates, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/03-538-night-one-debates.png")
```

Naturally, we wanted to see how popular each democratic candidate did *after* the first round of [2019 Democratic Presidential Debates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Democratic_Party_presidential_debates_and_forums), but we'd missed all the coverage.

This document outlines the data import, wrangling, and visulizations used in this project. Below is a folder tree of this project so you can get oriented to it's structure. 

```{r project-files}
fs::dir_tree("code", recurse = TRUE)    
```

## Data sources 

These data come from four different sources: Google trends, twitter, Google sheets, and Wikipedia. Details on the data sources are found the `00-download-` files below. 

```{r download-scripts}
fs::dir_ls("code", regexp = "download")
```

## Import the data

The code chunk below will run in `01-import.R` file and load all the data into the RStudio session. 

```{r 01-import, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
source("code/01-import.R")
```

The data sources are all `CamelCase` (read more about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case)), so we can list them using the code chunk below. 

```{r data-sets}
ls(pattern = "[A-Z]+")
```

## The democratic candidates (night 1)

There were ten candidates in the first night of debates, and all are listed alphabetically below. 

```{r dem_cand_2020}
dem_candidates <- c("Warren", "Ryan", "O'Rourke", "Klobuchar", "Inslee", 
                    "Gabbard", "Delaney", "de Blasio", "Castro", "Booker")
base::writeLines(dem_candidates)
```

### The Wikipedia table

[Wikipedia page on 2020 democratic debates (first night)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Democratic_Party_presidential_debates_and_forums#First_debates_(June_26%E2%80%9327,_2019)). 

The data, `WikiDemAirTime01Raw` and `WikiDemAirTime02Raw` are in the work session below. 

```{r WikiDemAirTime01}
WikiDemAirTime01Raw %>% utils::str()
WikiDemAirTime02Raw %>% utils::str()
```

We can see these two tables have some extra information in them, so they'll need a bit of wrangling work done. 

### Google trends data

We're interested in collecting data from June 25, 2019 until June 27, 2019 to get a gauge of how well (or how bad) each candidate did in terms of gaining interest (as measured by Google search trends). The Google search trends are accessible via the [gtrendsR](https://github.com/PMassicotte/gtrendsR) package.  

### Google search terms 

Each candidates name was searched for with "2020". We thought it would be a good idea to add "2020" to the candidates name to make it easier to identify searches that corresponded to the interested with the upcoming election. 

These data are stored in `GoogleData` list (visibile below).

```{r GoogleData}
GoogleData %>% utils::str(max.level = 2)
```

## Wrangle the data

See the script for more details.

```{r wrangle, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
source("code/02-wrangle.R")
ls(pattern = "[A-Z]+")
```

# Exploratory Data Analysis

We will use tables and graphs to explore the data we imported and wrangled and see if it looks like the `fivethirtyeight` data. We will start with a table of the data on voter preferences on candidates before and after the night of the election. 

```{r GSheetCand538Fav}
dplyr::filter(GSheetCand538Fav, candidate %in% c("Elizabeth Warren",
   "Tim Ryan", "Beto Oâ€™Rourke", "Amy Klobuchar", "Jay Inslee",
   "Tulsi Gabbard", "John Delaney", "Bill de Blasio", "Julian Castro",
   "Cory Booker")) %>% 
  DT::datatable(data = ., colnames = c("Democratic Candidate", 
    "Before the election", "After the first election",
    "After the second election"), 
    caption = 'source: https://53eig.ht/2Yg0Smp')
```

This looks identical to the data in the figure on the [article](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/democratic-debate-poll/). We will compare this to the data from the wikipedia table. 

```{r WikiPollCriterion}
knitr::kable(
WikiPollCriterion, align = 'c')
```


We like to start with visualizing as much of the data as possible. These two graphs tell us 1) "what kind of variables are in the data set?" and 2) "how much are missing?"

```{r visdat-inspectdf}
visdat::vis_dat(WikiPollCriterion) + 
  ggplot2::coord_flip()
```

## Google trend data 

The next few visualizations are of the Google trend data. 

### Candidates with high polling criterions 

When we look at the candidates with the highest percent of polling criterion on the 26th, we see the following:

```{r top-3-candidates}
GtrendWikiIOTAirTime %>% 
  dplyr::filter(poll_perc_fct == "> 10.0% of voters") %>% 
  ggplot2::ggplot(aes(x = date, 
             y = hits, 
             color = keyword)) +
  ggplot2::geom_line(aes(group = keyword), show.legend = FALSE) + 
  ggplot2::labs(
    x = "Date",
    y = "Google search hits",
  subtitle = "Google trends for candidates with > 10.0% polling") + 
  ggthemes::theme_wsj(base_size = 7.5, 
                      title_family = "mono") +
  ggplot2::facet_wrap(~ keyword, ncol = 2)
```

This shows Warren doing well after the first night. If we narrow this down to the week of the debates and widen the list of candidates, we see the following:

### Candidates with low polling criterions

```{r 7-day-top-3}
GtrendWikiIOTAirTime7day <- GtrendWikiIOTAirTime %>% 
                                   dplyr::filter(date >= "2019-06-22" & 
                                                 date < "2019-06-30")
GtrendWikiIOTAirTime7day %>% 
  dplyr::filter(poll_perc_fct %in% c("> 10.0% of voters", 
                                     "2-4.0% of voters")) %>% 
  ggplot2::ggplot(aes(x = date, 
             y = hits, 
             color = keyword)) +
  ggplot2::geom_line(aes(group = keyword), show.legend = FALSE) + 
  ggplot2::labs(
    x = "Date",
    y = "Google search hits",
    title = "Google search hits",
    subtitle = "Democratic candidates with 1.0-4.0% of voters") + 
  ggthemes::theme_clean(base_size = 7.5) +
  ggplot2::facet_wrap(~ keyword, ncol = 2)
```

Now we can see Warren is definitely ahead of O'Rourke, but Booker has also moved above Warren. 

### Candidates with low polling criterions

For candidates in the lowest percentage of Polling Criterion, `1 - 1.3% of voters` we see the following: 

```{r google-middle-percent-candidates}
GtrendWikiIOTAirTime7day %>% 
  dplyr::filter(poll_perc_fct %in% c("> 10.0% of voters", 
                                     "2-4.0% of voters",
                                     "1 - 1.3% of voters")) %>% 
  ggplot2::ggplot(aes(x = date, 
             y = hits, 
             color = keyword)) +
  ggplot2::geom_line(aes(group = keyword), show.legend = FALSE) + 
  ggplot2::labs(
    x = "Date",
    y = "Google search hits",
    caption = paste0("Google search hits between ", 
                   min(GtrendWikiIOTAirTime7day$date),
                   " and ",
                   max(GtrendWikiIOTAirTime7day$date)),
    subtitle = "Google search hits for democratic candidates") + 
    ggthemes::theme_tufte(base_size = 7) +
    ggplot2::facet_wrap(~ keyword, ncol = 2)
```

This looks like Gabbard had a better night on Google than the other four candidates in this group.

### Women candidates

We can also check the `gender` categorical variable to see how the candidates break down across `Men` and `Women`

```{r Dems2020Debate01IOT-date-hits-women}
GtrendWikiIOTAirTime7day %>% 
  dplyr::filter(gender == "Women") %>% 
  ggplot2::ggplot(aes(x = date, 
             y = hits, 
             color = keyword)) +
  ggplot2::geom_line(aes(group = keyword), show.legend = FALSE) + 
  ggplot2::labs(subtitle = "Women Democratic Candidates",
    caption = paste0("Data between ", 
                   min(GtrendWikiIOTAirTime7day$date),
                   " and ",
                   max(GtrendWikiIOTAirTime7day$date))) + 
  ggthemes::theme_fivethirtyeight(base_size = 8) + 
  ggplot2::facet_wrap(. ~ keyword)
```

This shows Gubbard outperforming Warren in Google searches. And as for the men...

### Men candidates

We're going to use a different theme (`ggthemes::theme_tufte`) to look at the 

```{r GtrendWikiIOTAirTime7day-date-hits-men}
font <- "Helvetica"
GtrendWikiIOTAirTime7day %>% 
  dplyr::filter(gender == "Men") %>% 
  ggplot2::ggplot(aes(x = date, 
             y = hits, 
             color = keyword)) +
  ggplot2::geom_line(aes(group = keyword), 
            show.legend = FALSE) + 
  ggplot2::labs(
    x = "Date",
    y = "Google search hits",
    subtitle = "Google search trends for June 26, 2019 Democratic candidates",
    caption = "source: http://bit.ly/2SKZXt4") +
  ggthemes::theme_few() +
  ggplot2::facet_wrap(. ~ keyword, ncol = 3)
```

This shows Cory Booker doing the best, followed by John Delany. 

## Twitter data 

The twitter data for the first night of candidates are below. These data were collected ~1 week after the debates and the figure below shows the most common content for each metadata variable about the tweets. 

```{r TwitterDataPlotImb, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
TwitterDataPlotImb <- TwitterData %>% 
  inspectdf::inspect_imb() 
TwitterDataPlotImb %>% 
  inspectdf::show_plot(col_palette = 2)
```


```{r ts_plot}
TwitterData %>%
  ts_plot("3 hours") +
  ggplot2::theme_minimal() +
  ggplot2::theme(plot.title = 
                   ggplot2::element_text(face = "bold")) 
```

The twitter search string included all the candidates, so this will need some additional cleaning/wrangling to figure out who is driving the trends. 

### Summarize Interest Data

What does the interest look like by location (i.e. `"region"`)? 

We've created a new data structure `Dems2020InterestByRegion`. What does it look like? We can use `skimr::skim_to_wide()` to answer this.

```{r Dems2020InterestByRegion}
# recheck the structure
GtrendDems2020InterestByRegion %>%
  skimr::skim_to_wide() %>% 
  dplyr::filter(type %in% c("integer", "numeric")) %>% 
  dplyr::select(variable, 
                n, 
                mean, 
                sd, 
                median = p50, 
                hist)
```

### Map the data by state

It looks like the variable of interest (`hits`) is pretty lopsided--what can we do about it? After googling, we discover [this article](https://medium.com/@TheDataGyan/day-8-data-transformation-skewness-normalization-and-much-more-4c144d370e55) with this information, 

> "The logarithm, x to log base 10 of x, or x to log base e of x (ln x), or x to log base 2 of x, is a strong transformation and can be used to reduce right skewness."

Now we've documented our thought process (the "why"), and can log-transform the data in the next graph. 

## Tulsi Gabbard 2020 searches

```{r visualize-Gabbard-locations}
GtrendDems2020InterestByRegion %>% 
  dplyr::filter(keyword %in% "Tulsi Gabbard 2020") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = long, 
             y = lat)) +
  ggplot2::geom_polygon(aes(group = group,
                   # get the log(hits)
                   fill = log(hits)), 
                   color = "white") + 
  ggthemes::theme_map() + 
  ggplot2::labs(
    title = "Google searches for Tulsi Gabbard in 2020 on June 26, 2019",
    subtitle = "lighter colors = more searches for 'Tulsi Gabbard 2020'",
    caption = "using RStudio and gtrendsR") 
```

## Cory Booker 2020 searches

These are the searches for Cory Booker on states. 

```{r visualize-Booker-locations}
GtrendDems2020InterestByRegion %>% 
  dplyr::filter(keyword == "Cory Booker 2020") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = long, 
             y = lat)) +
  ggplot2::geom_polygon(aes(group = group,
                   # get the log(hits)
                   fill = log(hits)), 
                   color = "white") + 
  ggthemes::theme_map() + 
  ggplot2::labs(
    title = "Google searches for Cory Booker in 2020 on June 26, 2019",
    subtitle = "lighter colors = more searches for 'Cory Booker 2020'",
    caption = "using RStudio and gtrendsR")
```
