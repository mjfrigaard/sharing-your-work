```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Read more details on using R Markdown [here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/).

Load the `tidyverse`.

```{r tidyverse, echo=TRUE}
tidyverse::tidyverse_logo()
```


When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r starwars}
ggplot2::diamonds %>% glimpse(78)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r carat-price}
diamonds %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = carat,
               y = price,
               color = cut)) + geom_point()
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
