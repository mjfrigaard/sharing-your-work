Your book's page size is 8.5 inches wide by 11.0 inches high.

The page size is determined by your book's theme, which can be configured [here](https://leanpub.com/showingyourwork/theme). Your image size will vary based on it's resolution, measured in pixels per inch (PPI), multiplied by the available space.

The image formats that we support are PNG, JPEG, and GIF.

For photos, you should use a JPEG image of at least 72 PPI.
For line drawings, you should use a PNG image of at least a 150 PPI.
For photo and text combinations, 72 PPI or 150 PPI PNG images are probably best.
