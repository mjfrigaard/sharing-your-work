## Images (from Leanpub)

Your book's page size is 8.5 inches wide by 11.0 inches high.

The page size is determined by your book's theme, which can be configured [here](https://leanpub.com/showingyourwork/theme). Your image size will vary based on it's resolution, measured in pixels per inch (PPI), multiplied by the available space.

The image formats that we support are PNG, JPEG, and GIF.

For photos, you should use a JPEG image of at least 72 PPI.
For line drawings, you should use a PNG image of at least a 150 PPI.
For photo and text combinations, 72 PPI or 150 PPI PNG images are probably best.

### Images in Your Book

The maximum size for an image in your book will be smaller than the cover image since the pages in your book have a margin. These are some maximum image sizes to choose from, at various resolutions.

72 PPI image: 468 pixels wide x 648 pixels high.
150 PPI image: 975 pixels wide x 1350 pixels high.
300 PPI image: 1950 pixels wide x 2700 pixels high.


### Your Book's Cover Image

These are some cover image sizes to choose from, at various resolutions. If you use one of these size and resolution combinations, your cover image should look good:

300 PPI image: 2550 pixels wide x 3300 pixels high.
