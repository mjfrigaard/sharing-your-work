# Part 1: Modern research

This first section covers why we need reproducible research in both academia and the private sector. We explain what we've found at various universities and companies, and how you'll benefit by adopting the best practices in either arena. 

## Modern research in academia 

Science has undergone significant changes in the last 10+ years. Personal computers made writing papers and analyzing data accessible to more scientists, and the internet has made publishing faster and easier. Unfortunately, there are areas where academic research hasn't caught up with modern communication methods. [Jeff Leek](http://jtleek.com/), biostatistician and Professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, describes these changes and others in his excellent book, ["How to be a modern scientist"](https://leanpub.com/modernscientist), 

> *The modern academic scientist develops code in the open, publishes data and code open-source, posts preprints of their academic work, still submits to traditional journals, and reviews for those journals, but may also write blog posts or use social media to critique published work in post-publication review fora. These activities can dramatically increase the profile of scientists, particularly junior scientists if done well. But their value for important career milestones such as promotion and tenure or getting grants is still often muted or fuzzy.*

It's been over three years since Dr. Leek published his text, and the quote has only become more accurate. The good news is that more modern scientific work is [done in the open](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-01414-6), using [open source code and software](https://www.nature.com/articles/nphys3313), with [pre-prints](https://peerj.com/collections/50-practicaldatascistats/) and [social media](https://twitter.com/hashtag/datascience?lang=en) (and other [mediums to communicate](https://www.listennotes.com/search/?q=data%20science&scope=podcast)). 

Unfortunately, a lot of science isn't done using modern methods. According to [a 2018 article PLoS](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0202447), only 14% of public health professionals are using reproducible methods. This situation doesn't look good considering the quote above is from a professor of biostatistics at a prominent university. 

These findings add to a landscape where many scientists believe [science is in the midst of a reproducibility crisis](https://www.nature.com/news/1.19970), hackers are trying (and succeeding) at [making every scientific journal article free](https://www.sciencealert.com/this-woman-has-illegally-uploaded-millions-of-journal-articles-in-an-attempt-to-open-up-science), and major universities are dropping their multi-million dollar annual subscription contracts with [peer-reviewed publishing companies](https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/2019/6/3/18271538/open-access-elsevier-california-sci-hub-academic-paywalls). This sounds like scientists would be embracing new ways of communicating their research, right? It's a bit more complicated than that.

### Communicate effectively (and wisely)

Broad visibility has always been difficult for scientists. As the quote above alludes to, it's quite possible an academic hiring committee might not see the value in maintaining a blog, developing open-source software packages, or sharing your code. You can take some comfort knowing science eventually course-corrects, and you're just ahead of the curve. It's become clear that the traditional advice of "*publish or perish*" has lead to creating a [confusing mountain of papers](https://www.nature.com/news/the-top-100-papers-1.16224), and encouraged citation metrics which are [easily gamed and manipulated](https://academic.oup.com/gigascience/article/8/6/giz053/5506490). The precise details of how scientific productivity and contribution gets measured in the future remains somewhat uncertain, but we're confident the tools in this manual will provide you with a powerful set of skills that can be applied across a wide range of fields and professions.

## Modern research in companies

This section outlines how successful companies have adopted scientific principles. We will cover how having a data-driven decision framework has resulted in better products and services, and how becoming a "pragmatic scientist" can help your organization dispose of bad ideas quickly.

### Modern companies use data

Data has been the raw material used to create business opportunities and products previous generations hardly imagined possible. Google, Netflix, Airbnb, Uber, etc. are all companies who lifeblood is data. They use data to identify customers, and experiment on new features and products.

### Science and the internet

This manual is about getting your good work discovered by the right people, in the right fields, and in a way that advances your professional goals (and leads to more good work). We see this as a "win-win" because good work should be shared, and people should get rewarded for creating and sharing good work. 

The internet has made information easily accessible to everyone, and most people are walking around with more computational power in their pockets than previous generations ever imagined possible. With a laptop and internet browser, we can get access to nearly all the accumulated knowledge of the human species (and an unreasonable number of cat pictures). Part of this reason this is all so amazing is the relatively short time it took to happen.

Here is an example to demonstrate this rate of change: in a [2000 paper in Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/21987) by Steve Lawrence and C. Lee Giles titled, "Accessibility of information on the web." The authors open with what was considered by many to be a jaw-dropping statistic at the time, "*[the internet] is 800 million pages, encompassing about six terabytes of text data on about 3 million servers.*." 

Sixteen years later, Google will claim to be indexing [130 trillion pages](https://searchengineland.com/googles-search-indexes-hits-130-trillion-pages-documents-263378) across the web. At the time of this writing, the Indexed Web has an estimated 5.64 billion pages ( [Monday, 10 June 2019](https://www.worldwidewebsize.com/) ).

We've never had more access to information than we do right now, and it's unlikely that there will ever be less available information any time soon. 

### Getting your science noticed on the internet

> "*Your work should speak for itself...*" - author unknown

The sea of information on the internet means competing voices for your audience's attention. All that excellent work you're doing needs to be discoverable on the internet by people who can advance (and refine) your ideas. For that to happen, you have to create more than just a single artifact (like a thesis, dissertation, or white paper). If your future collaborators, prospective employers, and fellow graduate students are going to find what you're up to, it means keeping an ongoing catalog of what you've done and making sure it's discoverable by searching the internet. And unless you're willing to pay for advertisements, that means creating useful content that people read and share. 

![](images/00-the-internet.png)

***Don't rely solely on scientific publications to showcase your work***

> "*What a strange document a scientific journal article is. We work on them for months or even years. We write them in a highly specialized vernacular that even most other scientists don't share. We place them behind a paywall and charge something ridiculous, like $34.95, for the privilege of reading them. We so readily accept their inaccessibility that we have to start "journal clubs" in the hopes that our friends might understand them and summarize them for us.*" - [ScienceMag - How to read a scientific paper](https://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2016/01/how-read-scientific-paper)

Peer-reviewed papers are essential to advancing science and your career as an academic researcher. These papers represent the end of a long process in which you've demonstrated many different skills (reading and summarizing previous research, designing a study, data analysis, and communication). But publications also fail to capture many essential skills and abilities you'll want to share. This sentiment is summarized well in the quote from [Jonathan Buckheit and David Donoho at Stanford](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~wavelab/Wavelab_850/wavelab.pdf),

> "*An article about computational science in a scientific publication is not the scholarship itself; it is merely advertising of the scholarship. The actual scholarship is the complete software development environment and the complete set of instructions which generated the figures.*." 

Like most advertising, peer-reviewed papers leave out many of the essential details. 

*A special note for graduate students,*
*Provided you did your [research](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-graduate-schools/top-graduate-schools/paying), a postgraduate school degree is still likely to be an excellent investment for your future. And after a few challenging years and sleepless nights, you'll be on your way to a rewarding career. We loved graduate school--we made friends and colleagues we are still in contact with and received some excellent advice from outstanding (and unexpected) mentors. As we write this, the cost of college tuition has grown faster than the amount of [financial aid available](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/10/25/tuition-and-fees-still-rising-faster-aid-college-board-report-shows), and studies are showing degrees in some fields [have more value than others](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-09/uok-coc091115.php). In recognition of these changes, we decided to write a technical guide that covered a few topics that were missing from our graduate education. We wanted to share what we've learned with the hopes it would make the transition from school to work a little less shocking.*

## Computer science and science

Computers, code, and the internet have become pretty standard in modern professional work, especially if that work involves research. Just about every field of science now has a 'computational' area or journal to accompany it.  [Archaeologists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_archaeology) use computers to study geographical information systems (GIS) data and simulate human behavior.  [Chemists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_chemistry) use data and simulation to determine the arrangements and features of molecules and particles, or to estimate binding affinities for drug molecules on a given receptor or target. [Biologists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_biology) use computers to build models and simulate biological, ecological, behavioral, and social systems. The list goes on and on:

 * [Economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_economics)  
 * [History](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_history)  
 * [Finance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_finance)  
 * [Linguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_linguistics)  
 * [Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_law)   
 * [Sociology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_sociology)  

I suspect most of the people in these fields probably weren't thinking they'd be writing code or designing algorithms, but the widespread adoption of computation throughout science is a sign of its near-universal utility. To fully capitalize on the potential of what our computers can do, we need to dig a little deeper into how they work (and how we interact with them).

### Examples

We'll introduce you to the technologies, methods, and mediums used by successful scientists who are excellent communicators for their work. These scientists use the internet as a tool to engage with broader audiences, create better tools for doing science, document some of their daily struggles/successes, and share more about what it means to conduct research. 

For example,  [Lucy D'Agostino McGowan](https://www.lucymcgowan.com/) is a post-doc at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Health. She maintains a [blog](https://livefreeordichotomize.com/), publishes [ebooks](https://leanpub.com/ggplot2in2), has [online courses](https://leanpub.com/u/lucymcgowan), and also attempts to create a [real BB-8](https://magazine.amstat.org/blog/2017/11/01/lucy-dagostino-mcgowan-and-ryan-jarrett/). Her work is *highly discoverable* and showcases a wide range of skills. 

Or take Thomas Lin Pedersen, a former bioinformaticist who now designs software. His graduate research was on tools to analyze [hierarchical pangenome data](https://vimeo.com/181004000), which he turned into a [tool](https://www.data-imaginist.com/panviz/), made the [code free](https://github.com/thomasp85/PanViz), and [published](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28057677) his work in a scientific journal. He's also an [artist](https://www.instagram.com/thomasp85_/).

Both of these researchers did two things very well: they created outstanding work, and they put it online for people to find. Of course, they had to know their subject areas, and have something worth sharing online, but they didn't wait until they were done with their research, either. They started engaging with people while they were completing their research training.

### Technical jargon & acronyms 

> "*You must learn to talk clearly. The jargon of scientific terminology which rolls off your tongues is mental garbage*." - Martin H. Fischer

The most substantial barrier to understanding new disciplines or technologies is getting a handle on their jargon. Because this manual sits at the intersection of computer science, statistics, and web technologies, all the new vocabulary can often seem like learning a foreign language. 

Wherever possible, we'll do our best to clear up or define any terms related to computer science, data management system, web technology, or statistics. To maximize the power of the tools in this text, it will help to know a little about their history, so we'll also cover some background.

### Communication takes practice

No one is born with an ability to write well--it takes a lot of practice and feedback. The more you communicate with different audiences about your research, the better you'll get at finding an ability to convey its importance. 

The best science writers capture their audience by weaving science into a compelling narrative. Carl Sagan, Mary Roach, Freeman Dyson, Jared Diamond--all of these authors have a unique talent for making complicated, intricate scientific topics enjoyable by engaging us with the people in the story. By entering graduate school and doing your research, you're now one of the people in the story, contributing to the research topic. It's your job to tell your portion of the story. 

Remember, **science is a method, not a product**. That process of how you found what you found is the most critical part of your research because it's the part that tells us 1) why we can trust what you published, and 2) how we can try to reproduce your findings. 

When we were kids in math class, the teacher would ask us to "show our work." Teachers gave these instructions so they could follow our thought processes through a problem, and see where our thinking was incomplete or mistaken (and probably also to make sure we weren't looking at someone else's paper). If you're regularly showing your work, you'll be able to follow your line of thinking as you progress throughout your career. More importantly, people who find your work will see you're an actual human, with a full range of human experiences, and much more than a CV, résumé, or headshot. 

---

## Looking ahead
 
Communication should be the goal of data scientists. After leaving graduate school, we realized how few people had the skills we were taking into the world (and how many people would benefit from them). One of the most attractive things about understanding math and science is that small investments in understanding can yield substantial returns. 

You probably haven't heard the importance of being 'good enough' at math and science, and that's a shame. Being 'good enough' means you could read about a tool or technology and be capable of distinguishing it from magic, or that you can imagine a metric that might matter to your business or personal life, and then devise a way to measure it. Perhaps more importantly, an emphasis on a 'good enough' understanding of math and science could help break down the "us vs. them" mentality that arises when science inevitably makes its way into the public sphere. 

In our opinion, the job of a scientist or researcher isn't done when they defend a thesis/dissertation and graduate; it isn't done when they publish their research or present at a conference; it isn't even done when another scientist reads that article or attends their talk. 

As researchers and scientists, we consider our jobs done when someone has heard and understood our research, knows the impact it will have on the world and can reproduce what we've found. 

We sincerely hope you'll find this information useful and give us feedback at `mfrigaard@paradigmdata.io` or `pspangler@paradigmdata.io.`

- The scientific journal industry is not looking out for your best interests. They have a [clearly unethical business model](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/aug/29/academic-publishers-murdoch-socialist), and other [prominent universities can't afford their prices](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/apr/24/harvard-university-journal-publishers-prices).
