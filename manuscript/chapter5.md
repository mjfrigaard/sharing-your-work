# Part 5: putting it all together (and getting it online)

In this last chapter, we are going to make some changes to the files in our project, create new tables and figures, and push everything online in a way that people can find and discover our work.

### Git terminology

Below are some commonly used terms/commands associated with Git and Github.

*commits* - commits are the staple in Git/Github the workflow. Commits are what Git uses to track the changes you've made to files or folders, so they can be considered nouns ("I'm creating a commit with these changes") or verbs (I am going to commit these changes to my project"). 

To quote David Demaree, 

> * "Semantically, each commit represents a complete snapshot of the state of your project at a given moment in time; its unique identifier serves to distinguish that state from the way the files in your project looked at any other moment in time."* 

*repository* - this refers to the files and folders in your project and all the changes you make while working on them. On your local computer, a repository can exist in a folder you initialize a repository in (see below). On Github, a repository has the following structure: `https://github.com/<username>/<repository_name>`. 

*init* - the command `git init` is used to initialize a new git repository (it tells Git to start tracking changes in this directory).

*status* - whenever you wonder what you've done, what is happening, or if you're just generally confused, you can check the status of a git repository with `git status` (use this liberally). 

*clone* - this command copies all files and changes into a new working directory from a remote, initializes (`init`) a new Git repository, and it adds a remote called `origin`.

*diff* - this is how Git shows differences between files. Read more about how changes are formatted/displayed [here.](https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/ebook/en/command-line/advanced-topics/diffs)
