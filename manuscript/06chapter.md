### Writing = thinking with words

At the very minimum, a researcher should be able to communicate 1) the problem they found, 2) their proposed solution, 3) what they did, and 4) what they observed. Each of these steps has too much detail for pointing and clicking. 

Every area of research has it's own jargon and acronyms, and it can be challenging to explain complicated concepts in plain language. But we've found doing this is worth the effort because the process allows you to sort through your thoughts on a topic, develop new analogies, and make new connections. 

I highly recommend the article [The Science of Science Writing](https://www.americanscientist.org/blog/the-long-view/the-science-of-scientific-writing) for anyone looking to improve their write technical writing abilities. I received some excellent advice along the way about prose, "*favor brevity above all else, but never sacrifice precision or clarity just to rush to the point*."
