# Appendix

These are additional resources and notes from the preceding chapters. 

## Intro

We wrote this with no intention of anyone actually memorizing all this information. Our goal was for you to have a reference you could refer back to and check when you need to brush up on how these tools fit together. 


## Chapter 1

These aren't new concepts--we're really just repeating things we've learned from people smarter than us on these topics. 

- Check out the [Data Carpentry lessons](https://datacarpentry.org/lessons/) for another great introduction to these tools
- The author of the paper above, Greg Wilson, has an [excellent blog](http://third-bit.com/) on teaching technology and all things awesome. 

## Chapter 2

- The Ford Foundation report, ["Roads and Bridges"](https://www.fordfoundation.org/about/library/reports-and-studies/roads-and-bridges-the-unseen-labor-behind-our-digital-infrastructure/), outlines some other reason you should be using open-source software.
- Read these articles on attentional residue and multitasking (then try to stop doing it):  
   1) [Why is it so hard to do my work? The challenge of attention residue when switching between work tasks](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749597809000399)
   2) [Information, Attention, and Decision Making](https://aom.org/uploadedFiles/Publications/AMJ/June_2015_FTE.pdf)
   3) [Causes, effects, and practicalities of everyday multitasking](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0273229714000513)
-  See [Baumer et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.1894) for an in-depth summary of why you should abandon a copy + paste workflow
- This text is also an *[opinionated technical manual](https://peerj.com/preprints/3210/)*, and covers topics left out of typical statistics texts,  
"*Statisticians have long shied away from teaching process, with the complaint that it might limit the creativity necessary to tackle different analytical problems. However, by not teaching opinionated analysis development, we subject fledgling data to each individually spin their wheels in coming up with process for avoiding common and generalized problems*."

## Chapter 3

Here are some excellent resources for safely adding the command line to your wheelhouse. 

* [The Unix Workbench](https://seankross.com/the-unix-workbench/) 

* [Data Science at the Command Line](https://www.datascienceatthecommandline.com/)

* [Software Carpentry Unix Workshop](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/) 


## Chapter 4 

There are a ton of resources on how to get started on a data analysis project. Some of our favorites are listed below:

+ [Data organization in spreadsheets](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2017.1375989)  

+ [Best practices organizing data science projects](https://www.thinkingondata.com/how-to-organize-data-science-projects/)
