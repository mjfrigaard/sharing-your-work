# Appendix

These are additional resources and notes from the preceding chapters. 

## Intro

- This text is also an *[opinionated technical manual](https://peerj.com/preprints/3210/)*, and covers topics left out of typical statistics texts,  
"*Statisticians have long shied away from teaching process, with the complaint that it might limit the creativity necessary to tackle different analytical problems. However, by not teaching opinionated analysis development, we subject fledgling data to each individually spin their wheels in coming up with process for avoiding common and generalized problems*."

## Chapter 1
