# Part 1: getting started 

Congratulations! You've just entered graduate school, and you're on your way to more specialized education and training. Hopefully, after a few challenging years and sleepless nights, you'll be on your way to a rewarding career. Provided you did your [research](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-graduate-schools/top-graduate-schools/paying), a graduate school degree is still likely to be an excellent investment for your future. 

I loved my graduate school experience. I made friends and colleagues I'm still in contact with, and received some excellent advice from outstanding (and unexpected) mentors. As I write this, the cost of college tuition has grown faster than the amount of [financial aid available](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/10/25/tuition-and-fees-still-rising-faster-aid-college-board-report-shows), and studies are showing degrees is some fields [have more value than others](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-09/uok-coc091115.php). In recognition of these changes, my colleague and I have decided to write this technical guide. We felt a few topics were missing from our graduate education, and wanted to share what we've learned in the hopes it would make the transition from school to work a little less shocking.

We sincerely hope you'll find this information useful and give us feedback at `mfrigaard@paradigmdata.io` or `pspangler@paradigmdata.io.`

## Who should read this

We wrote this book for any graduate student who will be doing research. Whether you're getting a Masters or a Ph.D., if you're doing research, this book is for you. 

## Assumptions we've made

We assume you've been working on a computer, but mostly to write papers (maybe using Word or Papers), send/receive emails, and explore the internet. Everyone enters graduate school at different times in their lives, so there is a good chance some of you will know the materials we are covering. If this is the case, hopefully, we cover it in a novel and exciting way that doesn't make reading it feel like a waste of time. 

## Language and style

Although one person put this information together in this particular format, we use the plural 'we' because this is the result of many conversations, emails, comment threads, and communications that could not have happened in isolation.

## You've made it! 

You have entered graduate school in amazing times. The internet has made information easily accessible to everyone, and most people are walking around with more computational power in their pockets than previous generations ever imagined possible. With a laptop and internet browser, we can get access to nearly all the accumulated knowledge of the human species (and an unreasonable number of cat pictures). Part of this reason this is all so amazing is the relatively short time it took to happen.

Here is an example to demonstrate this rate of change: in a [2000 paper in Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/21987) by Steve Lawrence and C. Lee Giles titled, "Accessibility of information on the web." The authors open with the jaw-dropping statistic that the internet is "*800 million pages, encompassing about six terabytes of text data on about 3 million servers.*." 

Sixteen years later, Google claims to be aware of [130 trillion pages](https://searchengineland.com/googles-search-indexes-hits-130-trillion-pages-documents-263378) across the web. Two years after that, Wikipedia has  5.71 million articles and is contributed to by [127,026 Wikipedians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedians) (people who actively edit Wikipedia articles). 

We've never had more access to information than we do right now, and it's unlikely that there will ever be less available information any time soon.

> "*Your work should speak for itself...*" - author unknown

All this information on the internet also means there are competing voices for content. The excellent work you'll do in graduate school needs to be discoverable on the internet, and that means making sure you have more than just a single thesis, dissertation, or manuscript. If your future collaborators, prospective employers, fellow graduate students, are going to be able to find a catalog of what you've done, you'll need examples written for multiple audiences. 

***Don't rely solely on your scientific papers to showcase your work*** 

> "*What a strange document a scientific journal article is. We work on them for months or even years. We write them in a highly specialized vernacular that even most other scientists don't share. We place them behind a paywall and charge something ridiculous, like $34.95, for the privilege of reading them. We so readily accept their inaccessibility that we have to start "journal clubs" in the hopes that our friends might understand them and summarize them for us.*" - [How to read a scientific paper](https://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2016/01/how-read-scientific-paper)

Be honest--how many theses/dissertations have you read? How many peer-reviewed articles would you read for pure enjoyment? I suspect that even if you asked your most bibliophilic friends what their favorite thesis is, or what dissertation they think everyone *must* read, they couldn't give you a single example? These documents aren't a waste of time--they serve a different purpose (and it's not to make sure all of your hard work reaches a broad audience).

Even if you decide to convert your graduate research into a peer-reviewed manuscript, it'll be for a very niche audience, and rarely in a way that makes the contents interesting beyond a few researchers who are closest to the subject matter. 

Scientific papers are still essential to advancing science (and your career as a scientist), but they're not a demonstration of all the skills you've developed in graduate school. These artifacts represent the end of a long process in which you've demonstrated many different skills (reading and summarizing previous research, designing a study, data analysis, and communication). This sentiment is summarized well in the quote from [Jonathan Buckheit and David Donoho at Stanford](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~wavelab/Wavelab_850/wavelab.pdf),

> "*An article about computational science in a scientific publication is not the scholarship itself, it is merely advertising of the scholarship. The actual scholarship is the complete software development environment and the complete set of instructions which generated the figures.*." 

And like most advertising, peer-reviewed papers leave many essential details out. For example, journal articles can't document how you ended up at the particular research question or hypothesis you tested (and why you had to change it). Neither the thesis/dissertation nor the peer-reviewed paper can document what you did in graduate school.  

* coming up with an idea, 
* turning that idea into a research question, 
* convincing people of that idea (or some version of it), 
* collecting your data, 
* teaching labs/lectures, 
* recruiting volunteers, 
* entering your data, 
* managing your committee member's expectations (and egos), 
* cleaning your data, 
* persuading someone to read early drafts, 
* politely reminding your committee to give you constructive criticism (promptly so you can graduate), and 
* solving a million other little day-to-day problems. 

A research paper written and edited by committee and powerpoint presentation won't capture most of these adventures, so if you want your work to count, it needs to be communicated to wider audiences, or even in other mediums. 

## People to emulate 

This book will show you some of the tools to make your work more discoverable. We'll introduce you to the technologies, methods, and places used by scientists who have successfully communicated their work. These scientists have used the internet as a tool to engage with broader audiences, create better tools for doing science, document some of their daily struggles/successes, and share more about what it means to conduct research. 

For example,  [Lucy D'Agostino McGowan](https://www.lucymcgowan.com/) is a post-doc at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Health. She maintains a [blog](https://livefreeordichotomize.com/), publishes [ebooks](https://leanpub.com/ggplot2in2), has [online courses](https://leanpub.com/u/lucymcgowan), and also attempts to create a [real BB-8](https://magazine.amstat.org/blog/2017/11/01/lucy-dagostino-mcgowan-and-ryan-jarrett/). Her work is *highly discoverable* and showcases a wide range of skills. 

Or take Thomas Lin Pedersen, a former bioinformaticist who now designs software. His graduate research was on tools to analyze [hierarchical pangenome data](https://vimeo.com/181004000), which he turned into a [tool](https://www.data-imaginist.com/panviz/), made the [code free](https://github.com/thomasp85/PanViz), and [published](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28057677) his work in a scientific journal. He's also an [artist](https://www.instagram.com/thomasp85_/).

Both of these researchers did two things very well: they created outstanding work, and they put it online for people to find. Of course, they had to know their subject areas, and have something worth sharing online, but they didn't wait until they were done with their research, either. They started engaging with people while they were completing their research training.

## Practicing communication

No one is born with an ability to write well--it takes a lot of practice and feedback. The more you communicate with different audiences about your research, the better you'll get at finding an ability to convey its importance. 

The best science writers capture their audience by weaving science into a compelling narrative. Carl Sagan, Mary Roach, Freeman Dyson, Jared Diamond--all of these authors have a unique talent for making complicated, intricate scientific topics enjoyable by engaging us with the people in the story. By entering graduate school and doing your research, you're now one of the people in the story, contributing to the research topic. It's your job to tell your portion of the story. 

Remember, **science is a method, not a product**. That process of how you found what you found is the most critical part of your research because it's the part that tells us 1) why we can trust what you published, and 2) how we can try to reproduce your findings. 

When we were kids in math class, the teacher would ask us to "show our work." Teachers gave these instructions so they could follow our thought processes through a problem, and see where our thinking was incomplete or mistaken (and probably also to make sure we weren't looking at someone else's paper). If you regularly show your work, you'll be able to follow your line of thinking as you progress through graduate school. More importantly, people who find your work will see you're an actual human, with a full range of human experiences, and not just another CV and headshot. 

## The path forward 
 
Communicating our work should be the goal of anyone doing research. After leaving graduate school, I realized how few people had the skills I was taking into the world (and how many people would benefit from them). One of the most attractive things about understanding math and science is that small investments in understanding can yield significant returns. 

I've realized we don't communicate the importance of being 'good enough' at math and science, and it's a shame. Being 'good enough' means you can read about technology and not be incapable of distinguishing it from magic, or that you can find a metric that matters to your business or personal life, and devise a way to measure it. Being 'good enough' also means knowing the difference between having the correct facts and persuading someone to listen to you. 

In our opinion, the job of a scientist or researcher isn't done when they defend a thesis/dissertation and get their degree; it isn't done when their research has been submitted and accepted to a conference or high-impact journal; it isn't even done when someone reads that article or attends their talk. 

As researchers, we consider our jobs are done when someone has heard and understood our research, and knows the impact it will have on the world.

#### Notes 

- The scientific journal industry is not looking out for your best interests. They have a [clearly unethical business model](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/aug/29/academic-publishers-murdoch-socialist), even [prominent universities can't afford their prices](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/apr/24/harvard-university-journal-publishers-prices) (which means fewer people reading your work), and they won't [compensate](https://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2011/09/01/the-racket-of-academic-publishing/) you for your efforts.

- The metrics previously used to measure success in academic publishing are [unreliable and susceptible to being gamed](https://academic.oup.com/gigascience/article/8/6/giz053/5506490). You don't want to have these be your sole measure of productivity.
