# 1) Showing your work: a guide for graduate students 

Congratulations! You've just entered graduate school, and you're on your way to more specialized education and training. Hopefully, after a few challenging years and sleepless nights, you'll be on your way to a rewarding career. Provided you did your [research](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-graduate-schools/top-graduate-schools/paying), a graduate school degree is still likely to be an excellent investment for your future. 

I loved my graduate school experience. I made friends and colleagues I'm still in contact with, and received some excellent advice from outstanding (and unexpected) mentors. As I write this, the cost of college tuition has grown faster than the amount of [financial aid available](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/10/25/tuition-and-fees-still-rising-faster-aid-college-board-report-shows), and studies are showing degrees is some fields [have more value than others](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-09/uok-coc091115.php). In recognition of these changes, my colleague and I have decided to write this technical guide. We felt a few topics were missing from our graduate education, and wanted to share what we've learned in the hopes it would make the transition from school to work a little less shocking.

We sincerely hope you'll find this information useful and give us feedback at `mfrigaard@paradigmdata.io` or `pspangler@paradigmdata.io.`

## Who should read this

We wrote this book for any graduate student who will be doing research. Whether you're getting a Masters or a Ph.D., if you're doing research, this book is for you. 

## Assumptions we are making

We assume you've been working on a computer, but mostly to write papers (maybe using Word or Papers), send/receive emails, and explore the internet. Everyone enters graduate school at different times in their lives, so there is a good chance some of you will know the materials we are covering. If this is the case, hopefully, we cover it in a novel and exciting way that doesn't make reading it feel like a waste of time.

## "It was the best of times; it was the worst of times."

You have entered graduate school in a fantastic time. Most people are walking around with more computational power in their pockets than previous generations ever imagined possible. An internet browser now gives you access to nearly all the accumulated knowledge of the human species (and an unreasonable number of cat pictures). As an example to how much has changed and how fast it's happened, consider a [2000 paper in Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/21987) by Steve Lawrence and C. Lee Giles titled, "Accessibility of information on the web." The authors open with the jaw-dropping statistic that the internet is "*800 million pages, encompassing about six terabytes of text data on about 3 million servers.*." 

Fast forward to 2016, and Google claims to be aware of [130 trillion pages](https://searchengineland.com/googles-search-indexes-hits-130-trillion-pages-documents-263378) across the web. Wikipedia has  5.71 million articles (as of September 2018) and is contributed to by [127,026 Wikipedians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedians) (people who actively edit Wikipedia articles). We've never had more access to information than we do right now, and it's unlikely that there will ever be less available information any time soon.

> "*Your work should speak for itself...*" - author unknown

All the information on the internet also means there are competing voices for whose content gets read. You need the work you do in graduate school to be discoverable on the internet, and that means making sure you have more than just a single thesis, dissertation, or manuscript. If your future collaborators, prospective employers, fellow graduate students, are going to be able to find a catalog of what you've done, you'll need examples written for multiple audiences. 

*** Don't rely solely on your scientific papers to showcase your work*** 

Be honest--how many theses/dissertations have you read? Ask your most bibliophilic friends what their favorite thesis is, or what dissertation they think everyone *must* read? These documents aren't a waste of time--they serve a different purpose (and it's not to make sure all of your hard work reaches a broad audience).

Even if you decide to convert your graduate research into a peer-reviewed manuscript, it'll be for a very niche audience, and rarely in a way that makes the contents interesting beyond a few researchers who are closest to the subject matter. 

Scientific papers are still essential to advancing science (and your career as a scientist), but they're not a demonstration of all the skills you've developed in graduate school. These artifacts represent the end of a long process in which you've demonstrated many different skills (reading and summarizing previous research, designing a study, data analysis, and communication). This sentiment is summarized well in the quote from Jonathan Buckheit and David Donoho at Stanford,

> "*An article about computational science in a scientific publication is not the scholarship itself, it is merely advertising of the scholarship. The actual scholarship is the complete software development environment and the complete set of instructions which generated the figures.*." 

And like most advertising, peer-reviewed papers leave many essential details out. For example, journal articles can't document how you ended up at the particular research question or hypothesis you tested (and why you had to change it). Neither the thesis/dissertation nor the peer-reviewed paper can document what you did in graduate school.  

* coming up with an idea, 
* turning that idea into a research question, 
* convincing people of that idea (or some version of it), 
* collecting your data, 
* teaching labs/lectures, 
* recruiting volunteers, 
* entering your data, 
* managing your committee member's expectations (and egos), 
* cleaning your data, 
* persuading someone to read early drafts, 
* politely reminding your committee to give you constructive criticism (promptly so you can graduate), and 
* solving a million other little day-to-day problems. 

A research paper written and edited by committee and powerpoint presentation won't capture most of these adventures, so if you want your work to count, it needs to be communicated to wider audiences, or even in other mediums. 

## Examples of work

This book will show you some of the tools to make your work more discoverable. We'll introduce you to the technologies, methods, and places used by scientists who have successfully communicated their work. These scientists have used the internet as a tool to engage with broader audiences, create better tools for doing science, document some of their daily struggles/successes, and share more about what it means to conduct research. 

For example,  [Lucy D'Agostino McGowan](https://www.lucymcgowan.com/) is a post-doc at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Health. She maintains a [blog](https://livefreeordichotomize.com/), publishes [ebooks](https://leanpub.com/ggplot2in2), has [online courses](https://leanpub.com/u/lucymcgowan), and also attempts to create a [real BB-8](https://magazine.amstat.org/blog/2017/11/01/lucy-dagostino-mcgowan-and-ryan-jarrett/). Her work is highly discoverable. 

Or take Thomas Lin Pedersen, a former bioinformaticist who now designs software. His graduate research was on tools to analyze [hierarchical pangenome data](https://vimeo.com/181004000), which he turned into a [tool](https://www.data-imaginist.com/panviz/), made the [code free](https://github.com/thomasp85/PanViz), and [published](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28057677) his work. He's also an [artist](https://www.instagram.com/thomasp85_/).

Both of these researchers did two things very well: they created outstanding work, and they put it online for people to find. Of course, they had to know their subject areas, and have something worth sharing online, but they didn't wait until they were done with their research, either. They started engaging with people while they were completing their research training.

## Learning to communicate by practice

The best science writers capture their audience by weaving science into a compelling narrative. Carl Sagan, Mary Roach, Freeman Dyson, Jared Diamond--all of these authors have a unique talent for making complicated, intricate scientific topics enjoyable by engaging us with the people in the story. By entering graduate school and doing your research, you're now one of the people in that story. No one is born with an ability to write well--it takes a lot of practice and feedback. The more you communicate with different audiences about your research, the better you'll get at finding an ability to convey its importance. 

Lastly, science is a method, not a product. That process of how you found what you found is the most critical part of your research because it's the part that tells us 1) why we can trust what you published, and 2) how we can try to reproduce your findings. 

So when you think about it, all those early drafts of your proposal, the lines of code you've used to wrangle your data, the graphs, tables, and figures you've used to learn about the distributions and relationships between your variables, the random notes, and epiphanies, etc...*these artifacts are the real 'science'*. 

To quote [Roger Peng](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/334/6060/1226) from the Department of Biostatistics, in the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, 

> "the data and code used to make a finding are available and they are sufficient for an independent researcher to recreate the finding."

When we were kids in math class, the teacher would ask us to "Show our work." Teachers gave these instructions so they could follow our thought process through a problem. Communicating our work should be the goal of everyone doing research. If you think about it, our job isn't done as researchers when we defend our thesis/dissertation and get the degree; it isn't done when our research has been submitted and accepted to a conference or high-impact journal; it isn't even done when someone reads the article or attends the talk. 

As researchers, our jobs are done when someone has understood our research and the impact it will have on the world.

#### Notes 

- The scientific journal industry is not looking out for your best interests. They have a [clearly unethical business model](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/aug/29/academic-publishers-murdoch-socialist), even [prominent universities can't afford their prices](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/apr/24/harvard-university-journal-publishers-prices) (which means fewer people reading your work), and they won't [compensate](https://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2011/09/01/the-racket-of-academic-publishing/) you for your efforts.

- The metrics previously used to measure success in academic publishing are [unreliable and susceptible to being gamed](https://academic.oup.com/gigascience/article/8/6/giz053/5506490). You don't want to have these be your sole measure of productivity.
