# Git

Git can help users keep track of datasets, code, images, and text files. It's a [version control system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) (VCS), which is somewhat like the **Tracked Changes** in Microsoft Word, or **Version History** in Google Sheets. 

## Why should you use Git?

Git has become the most common version control system used by [programmers](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018#work-version-control). 

```{r images/git-most-common-vcs, echo=FALSE}
# fs::dir_ls("images")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/git-most-common-vcs.png")
```

Git is also a helpful way of thinking about the changes to your project. The terminology of Git is strange at first, but if you use Git long enough you'll be thinking about your code in terms of 'commits', 'pushes', 'forks', and 'repos'.

## Installing Git

1. Download and install [Git.](http://git-scm.org/)    
2. Create a [Github](https://github.com/) account.  


## Configuring Git with `git config`

Git needs a little configuration before we can start using it and linking it to Github. There are three levels of configuration within Git, `system`, `user`, and `project.` 

1) For **system** level configuration use:  
`git config --system`

2) For **user** level configuration, use:  
`git config --global`

3) For **Project** level configuration use:  
`git config`

I'll set my Git `user.name` and `user.email` with `git config --global` so these are configured for all projects on this computer. 

```bash
$ git config --global user.name "Martin Frigaard"
$ git config --global user.email "mjfrigaard@gmail.com"
```

I can check what I've configured with `git config --list`. 

```bash
$ git config --list
```

At the bottom of the output, I can see the changes. 

```bash
user.name=Martin Frigaard
user.email=mjfrigaard@gmail.com
```

These are also stored in a `.gitconfig` file I can view using:

```bash
$ cat .gitconfig
[user]
	name = Martin Frigaard
	email = mjfrigaard@gmail.com
```

## Git terminology

Below are some commonly used terms/commands associated with Git and Github.

*commits* - commits are the staple in Git/Github the workflow. Commits are what Git uses to track the changes you've made to files or folders, so they can considered nouns ("I'm creating a commit with these changes") or verbs (I am going to commit these changes to my project‚Äù). 

To quote David Demaree, *"Semantically, each commit represents a complete snapshot of the state of your project at a given moment in time; its unique identifier serves to distinguish that state from the way the files in your project looked at any other moment in time."* 

*repository* - this refers to the files and folders in your project and all the changes you make while working on them. On your local computer, a repository can exist in an folder you initialize a repository in (see below). On Github, a repository has the following structure: `https://github.com/<username>/<repository_name>`. 

*init* - the command `git init` is used to initialize a new git repository. This tells git to start tracking changes in this directory.

*status* - whenever you wonder what you've done, what is happening, or if you're just generally confused, you can check the status of a git repository with `git status` (use this liberally). 

*clone* - this command copies all files and changes into a new working directory from a remote, initializes (`init`) a new Git repository, and it adds a remote called `origin`.

*diff* - this is how Git shows differences between files. Read more about how differences are formatted/displayed [here.](https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/ebook/en/command-line/advanced-topics/diffs)

# An example project 

I have a project in a github [repository](https://github.com/mjfrigaard/swow-data-project) that has a `README.md` file, an .R script file (`1-import-export-sample.R`), and a .csv file (`2018-11-29-SwowSample.csv`) in it. 

The data are from the [Small World of Words](https://smallworldofwords.org/en/project) project. I'll clone this repository into a local directory (folder), read the data into R, create a figure, and then put everything back on Github. 

## Synchronize RStudio and Git/Github

The online resource [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](http://happygitwithr.com/) has all in the information you will need for connecting RStudio and Git/Github. I repeat some of that information below (with copious screen shots).

Go to *Tools* > *Global Options* > ...

```{r create-ssh-key-passphrase, echo=FALSE}
# fs::dir_ls("images")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/create-ssh-key-passphrase.png")
```

1. Click on *Git/SVN*  
2. Then *Create RSA Key...*  
3. In the dialog box, enter a passphrase (and store it in a safe place), then click *Create*. 

The result should look something like this:

```
whoeveryouare ~ $ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2891 -C "USEFUL-COMMENT"
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/username/.ssh/id_rsa):     
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again: 
Your identification has been saved in /Users/username/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /Users/username/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA483:g!bB3r!sHg!bB3r!sHg!bB3r!sH USEFUL-COMMENT
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 2891]----+
|      o+   . .   |
|     .=.o . +    |
|     ..= + +     |
|      .+* E      |
|     .= So =     |
|    .  +. = +    |
|   o.. = ..* .   |
|  o ++=.o =o.    |
| ..o.++o.=+.     |
+----[SHA483]-----+
```

Now I need to go back to Terminal and store this `SSH` from RStudio. 

## Adding a key SSH in Terminal

In the Terminal I enter the following commands. 

```bash
$ eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
```

This tells me I'm an `Agent`!

```bash
Agent pid 007
```

Now I want to add the *SSH RSA* to the keychain. There are three elements in this command: the `ssh-add`, the `-K`, and `~/.ssh/id_rsa`. 

* The `ssh-add` is the command to add the *SSH RSA*  
* The `-K` stores the passphrase I generated, and  
* `~/.ssh/id_rsa` is the location of the *SSH RSA*.  

```bash
$ ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

This will ask for the passphrase and then tell me the identity has been added.  

```bash
Enter passphrase for /Users/username/.ssh/id_rsa: 
Identity added: /Users/username/.ssh/id_rsa (username@Martins-MacBook-Pro.local)
```

## Create `~/.ssh/config` file

On macOS Sierra 10.12.2 or higher requires a `config` file. I can do this using the Terminal commands above. 

First, I move into the `~/.ssh/` directory. 

```bash
$ cd ~/.ssh/
```

Then I create this `config` file with `touch`.

```bash
$ touch config
# verify 
$ ls
config		id_rsa		id_rsa.pub
```

I use `echo` to add the following text to the `config` file.

```
Host *
 AddKeysToAgent yes
 UseKeychain yes
```

```bash
# add text 
$ echo "Host *
>  AddKeysToAgent yes
>  UseKeychain yes" >> config
```

Finally, I can check `config` with `cat`. 

```bash
# verify 
$ cat config
Host *
 AddKeysToAgent yes
 UseKeychain yes
```

Great! Now I am all set up to use Git with RStudio. Back to my project. 

## Clone a repo 

I've moved into a folder titled `NewProject` on my local machine using the two commands below. These can be executed from Terminal or in the Terminal pane in RStudio. 

```bash
$ cd /Users/username/Dropbox/Githubdemos/NewProject
$ ls
README.md
```

The project is stored in a repo with the following URL: `https://github.com/mjfrigaard/swow-data-project`. I will use `git clone` to move this into the `NewProject` folder. In the green box on the webpage, there is an option to copy the repo URL that ends with `.git`. 

```{r git-clone.png, echo=FALSE}
# fs::dir_ls("images")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/git-clone.png")
```

This is what I will use to clone the project locally. If I run these commands from RStudio, I should see the following. 

```{r git-clone-rstudio-terminal-pane.png, echo=FALSE}
# fs::dir_ls("images")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/git-clone-rstudio-terminal-pane.png")
```


After cloning the repo, I can check the contents of my working directory with `ls`. 

```bash
$ ls
README.md		swow-data-project
```

If I move into this folder with `cd`, and list the files I see the following:

```bash
$ cd swow-data-project/
$ ls
1-import-export-sample.R	README.md
2018-11-29-SwowSample.csv
```

```{r images/git-clone-local-folder.png, echo=FALSE}
# fs::dir_ls("images")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/git-clone-local-folder.png")
```

This is identical to the Github repo

```{r images/git-clone-github-folder.png, echo=FALSE}
# fs::dir_ls("images")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/git-clone-github-folder.png")
```


Cloning worked! Now we will move into the next section which covers how to use RStudio projects to organize your workflow.
